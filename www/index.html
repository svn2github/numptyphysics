<h1>Numpty Physics</h1>

Harness gravity with your crayon and set about creating blocks, ramps,
levers, pulleys and whatever else you fancy to get the little red
thing to the little yellow thing.<br>

Numpty Physics is a drawing puzzle game in the spirit (and style?)
of <a href="http://kloonigames.com/crayon">Crayon Physics</a> using
the same excellent <a href="http://www.box2d.org">Box2D engine</a>.
Note though that I've not actually played CP so the experience may be
very different.<p>

Numpty Physics is released under the GPL with the hope that others
with more spare time than myself will be able to round it out, polish
it, and above all create more levels (using the built in editor).<p>

<h3>Play</h3>

<b>Keys:</b><p>
<table>
<tr><td>stylus</td><td>draw a new stroke</td></tr>
<tr><td>space or enter (d-pad centre)</td><td>pause/unpause physics</td></tr>
<tr><td>esc (back arrow)</td><td>undo last stroke</td></tr>
<tr><td>esc (back arrow) hold</td><td>quit</td></tr>
<tr><td>r or up</td><td>reset level to initial state</td></tr>
<tr><td>n or right</td><td>skip to next level</td></tr>
<tr><td>p or left</td><td>go to previous level</td></tr>
<tr><td>e or fullscreen</td><td>edit mode</td></tr>
</table>

<b>Hints:</b><p>

Each stroke is like a rigid piece of wire with a mass proportional to
its length. A closed stroke is just a wire bent into a shape, it has
no substance apart from its perimeter.<p>

The ends of a strokes can (and will) join onto other strokes when
drawn near enough to another stroke.  These joints are pivots so you
can use this to build levers, pendulums and other mechanical wonders.
Jointed strokes don't collide with each other.  Join both ends to make
a rigid structure<p>

Known bugs: undo can go too far, goal item does not respawn if lost.


<h3>Editing</h3>

<b>Keys:</b> (as per play mode plus the following)<p>
<table>
<tr><td>e or fullscreen</td><td>leave edit mode</td></tr>
<tr><td>s or menu</td><td>save to ~/.numptyphsyics/L99_saved.nph</td></tr>
<tr><td>zoom-minus + stylus</td><td>delete stroke at point</td></tr>
<tr><td>zoom-plus + stylus</td><td>drag stroke at point</td></tr>
</table><p>

<b>Hints:</b><p>

It's handy to pause the physics when making a new level though this
is by no means necessary.  Sometimes it is handy to let the physics
run for a little bit just to let the items settle down.<p>

From the editor palette you can choose the crayon colour and then
additional properties such as:<p>

<ul>

<li>ground (earth arrow) - stroke is fixed in place.

<li>sleeping (Zzz) - stroke is not subject to physics until bumped by
something else.

<li>decorator (not shown) - stroke is not part of the physical
world. eg: tutorial text.

</ul>

Remember to set sensible properties and colour before exiting the
editor!<p>

You should make sure that your level has at least one red item (player
token) and at least one yellow item (goal item).<p>

Token strokes will only join to other token strokes.  Goal strokes
will only join to goal strokes.  Other strokes will happily join to
any non-token non-goal strokes.<p>

If this is your first time, you may need to restart the game for your
saved L99 to show up.<p>

If you wish to be clever, edit the level file directly - it's just a
simple text format.<p>

Editor bugs: move stroke is broken; delete stroke sometimes leaves a
new tiny stroke where you tapped (you can undo this at least).  There
is not yet any provision to name your level but you can just rename
the file. <p>
